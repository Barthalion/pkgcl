# PKGCL -- Get changelogs for Arch Linux packages

## Install
I've put this on the AUR here:

Or just, you know, download the script and put it wherever you like.

Depends on [nokogiri](http://rubygems.org/gems/nokogiri).

## Tested versions
I've tested this with `ruby 1.9.3p0 (2011-10-30 revision 33570) [x86_64-linux]`
and `nokogiri (1.5.0)`

## Note
This is my first ruby script that does anything useful, so I may have made grave
errors. Any and all suggestions are welcome!
